      <title>ACI: Spine replacement in a single Spine fabric</title>

      <description>A colleague has exchanged a spine at a customer. This is a lab fabric which runs in a minimal setup, 1 x APIC, 1 x Spine, 4 x Leaf.
In principle, the exchange of a Spine within an ACI fabric is a very simple undertaking, ACI does all the heavy lifting for you :)
However, in a scenario where a Leaf has only one path to the APIC (thus connected to a single Spine), the exchange of the Spine leads to problems.</description>

      <title>How to read out the used ACI basic parameters</title>

      <description>It happend to me more than once, that i needed the basic parameters that were used during the initial setup of the Fabric. For example if you configure a standby APIC later on, or if you (for whatever reason) reset and APIC and redo the initial configuration dialog.
Of course, we always document everything we do, so we could simply look the information up in the documentation! But there is a faster way, just hop onto one of the APICs and use a small cat command.</description>

      <title>Cisco ACI – Convert Leaf Ports (Uplink to Downlink)</title>
      <link>https://www.richardstrnad.ch/2018/10/01/cisco-aci-convert-leaf-uplink-to-downlink/</link>

      <guid>https://www.richardstrnad.ch/2018/10/01/cisco-aci-convert-leaf-uplink-to-downlink/</guid>
      <description>Since ACI release 3.1(1) it&amp;rsquo;s possible to use some of the Leaf Uplinks as Downlink Ports. This could help you out if there is a need for some 40/100G ports but you are currently only running 10/25G Leafs.
Currently the following Leafs support the conversion:
N9K-C9348GC-FXP  N9K-C93180LC-EX   N9K-C93180YC-FX  N9K-C93180YC-EX and N9K-C93180YC-EXU  N9K-C93108TC-EX  N9K-C93108TC-FX  N9K-C9336C-FX2 (only downlink to uplink conversion supported)   There are some limitations, check them out on the Cisco Page.</description>

      <description>With the introduction of the NX-OS like CLI Cisco also added the option to run commands on the switches directly from your apic. It&amp;rsquo;s now even easier to get some infos from one or multiple switches in your fabric.
Show switchname on a single fabric switch
1 2 3 4 5  apic1# fabric leaf01 show switchname ---------------------------------------------------------------- Node 101 (leaf01) ---------------------------------------------------------------- leaf01   You can also run commands on multiple devices</description>

      <description>Some time ago i posted how you can connect to a spine or leaf switch -&amp;gt; Connect to a leaf/spine switch
With the introduction of NX-OS, the syntax changed a bit. You have now first to drop back to the bash shell and then you can attach the switches. Password is still the same as for the APIC.

      <description>Get the standalone software here
First you have to copy the new nexus 9000 standalone firmware to the APIC:
1 2  admin@apic1:~&amp;gt; scp richy@YOURIP:Downloads/nxos.7.0.3.I2.2a.bin . nxos.7.0.3.I2.2a.bin 100% 513MB 9.2MB/s 00:56   And now you can push it to the appropriate Nexus 9000. (The user/password matches the APIC)
1 2 3  admin@apic1:~&amp;gt; scp nxos.7.0.3.I2.2a.bin admin@leaf02:bootflash Password: nxos.7.0.3.I2.2a.bin 100% 513MB 7.0MB/s 01:13   Now reboot the switch and break into the load prompt, this can be done with Control+C in Putty.</description>

      <description>Cisco introduced a NX-OS like CLI for the Cisco ACI Solution with release 1.2(1i).
In this post i will demonstrate some of the things that can be achieved through the NX-OS CLI.
!Important!
There is no safety net, if you issue something like &amp;lsquo;no tenant XXX&amp;rsquo; the configuration is gone!
No commit, warning or similar!
!Important!
Basics The NX-OS like CLI is the new default if you connect via SSH to the APIC</description>

Cisco made this process now way easier, with some cool new features.
In this short guide i used the current ACI release 1.1(1o), that you can grab directly from cisco here.
Upload the Firmware to the APIC You can now upload directly through your browser, no longer the need for a SCP/FTP Server!</description>

      <description>I did a upgrade of our ACI Lab Fabric last week and documented all the steps. The upgrade is really straightforward, but hopefully this guide still helps you 🙂
First you have to catch the desired Software, get them directly from cisco. You need APIC Release image for 1.0(3f) release (aci-apic-dk9.1.0.3f.iso) and the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software Release 11.0(3f) (aci-n9000-dk9.11.0.3f.bin). Get them here:

      <description>With the introduction of the NX-OS Cli, cisco changed the way how you connect to leaf/spine switches.
Find my updated post here.
There are several scenarios where you want to connect to your leaf and spine switches of the ACI fabric.
In this example we want to checkout the BGP Status.
First you connect to your APIC Controller through SSH:
1 2 3 4  $ ssh admin@10.32.5.100 Application Policy Infrastructure Controller admin@10.</description>
