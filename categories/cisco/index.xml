      <title>ACI: Spine replacement in a single Spine fabric</title>

      <description>A colleague has exchanged a spine at a customer. This is a lab fabric which runs in a minimal setup, 1 x APIC, 1 x Spine, 4 x Leaf.
In principle, the exchange of a Spine within an ACI fabric is a very simple undertaking, ACI does all the heavy lifting for you :)
However, in a scenario where a Leaf has only one path to the APIC (thus connected to a single Spine), the exchange of the Spine leads to problems.</description>

      <description>All new stuff is directly added to my netwrk.ch blog: https://netwrk.ch/posts/restconf/
I decided to migrate this blog here, which was based on wordpress for the past 8 years, to hugo. For this reason, all technical information stays here üòÅ
This post is a work in progress, as i&amp;rsquo;m currently using Restconf for different customer, I want to save/post some of the infos i discovered. Get a Portchannel Subinterface
Base URL for all the following examples</description>

      <title>How to read out the used ACI basic parameters</title>

      <description>It happend to me more than once, that i needed the basic parameters that were used during the initial setup of the Fabric. For example if you configure a standby APIC later on, or if you (for whatever reason) reset and APIC and redo the initial configuration dialog.
Of course, we always document everything we do, so we could simply look the information up in the documentation! But there is a faster way, just hop onto one of the APICs and use a small cat command.</description>

      <description>Cisco provides a custom ESXi Image/ISO to (re)install Hyperflex Servers. As i&amp;rsquo;m currently working on fully automating the deployment of a large quantity of there servers, i looked for a way to automate the reinstall of these Hyperflex Servers.
Unfortunately the ESXi Image provided by Cisco requires a confirmation at some point, i wanted to get rid of this. First i downloaded the current ISO file from Cisco (HX-ESXi-6.7U3-16316930-Cisco-Custom-6.7.3.5-install-only.iso).
Create the Image 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  cd /tmp mkdir iso cd iso mkdir ro_iso mkdir custom device=$(hdiutil attach -nomount ~/Downloads/HX-ESXi-6.</description>

      <description>As i described in another Post there is the possibility to change a ACI Leaf Uplink Port to Downlink mode. This can be useful if you require some 40/100G Ports but don&amp;rsquo;t want to add new Leafs.
If you now wan&amp;rsquo;t to convert some of these Downlinks back to Uplinks, you can follow this guide here.
Navigate to Fabric -&amp;gt; Pod and select the Leaf on which you wan&amp;rsquo;t to change the Port behaviour.</description>

      <title>Cisco ACI ‚Äì Convert Leaf Ports (Uplink to Downlink)</title>

      <guid>https://www.richardstrnad.ch/2018/10/01/cisco-aci-convert-leaf-uplink-to-downlink/</guid>
      <description>Since ACI release 3.1(1) it&amp;rsquo;s possible to use some of the Leaf Uplinks as Downlink Ports. This could help you out if there is a need for some 40/100G ports but you are currently only running 10/25G Leafs.
Currently the following Leafs support the conversion:
N9K-C9348GC-FXP  N9K-C93180LC-EX   N9K-C93180YC-FX  N9K-C93180YC-EX and N9K-C93180YC-EXU  N9K-C93108TC-EX  N9K-C93108TC-FX  N9K-C9336C-FX2 (only downlink to uplink conversion supported)   There are some limitations, check them out on the Cisco Page.</description>

      <description>With the introduction of the NX-OS like CLI Cisco also added the option to run commands on the switches directly from your apic. It&amp;rsquo;s now even easier to get some infos from one or multiple switches in your fabric.
Show switchname on a single fabric switch
1 2 3 4 5  apic1# fabric leaf01 show switchname ---------------------------------------------------------------- Node 101 (leaf01) ---------------------------------------------------------------- leaf01   You can also run commands on multiple devices</description>

With the introduction of NX-OS, the syntax changed a bit. You have now first to drop back to the bash shell and then you can attach the switches. Password is still the same as for the APIC.

      <description>Get the standalone software here
First you have to copy the new nexus 9000 standalone firmware to the APIC:
1 2  admin@apic1:~&amp;gt; scp richy@YOURIP:Downloads/nxos.7.0.3.I2.2a.bin . nxos.7.0.3.I2.2a.bin 100% 513MB 9.2MB/s 00:56   And now you can push it to the appropriate Nexus 9000. (The user/password matches the APIC)
1 2 3  admin@apic1:~&amp;gt; scp nxos.7.0.3.I2.2a.bin admin@leaf02:bootflash Password: nxos.7.0.3.I2.2a.bin 100% 513MB 7.0MB/s 01:13   Now reboot the switch and break into the load prompt, this can be done with Control+C in Putty.</description>

No commit, warning or similar!

      <description>Today i learnt that the Production Year and Week is &amp;lsquo;hidden&amp;rsquo; in the Cisco Serials üôÇ
The format of the serial is always like &amp;lsquo;xxxYYWWxxxx&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;YY&amp;rsquo; is Code for the Year, but not the Year itself! &amp;lsquo;WW&amp;rsquo; is the week of manufacture.
   Code Year     01 1997   02 1998   03 1999   04 2000   05 2001   06 2002   07 2003   08 2004   09 2005   10 2006   11 2007   12 2008   13 2009   14 2010   15 2011   16 2012   17 2013   18 2014   19 2015   20 2016       Code Week     1-5 January   6-9 February   10-14 March   15-18 April   19-22 May   23-27 June   28-31 July   32-35 August   36-40 September   41-44 October   45-48 November   49-52 December    </description>

      <description>Some time ago i posted how to do a upgrade of your ACI Fabric through CLI.
Cisco made this process now way easier, with some cool new features.
In this short guide i used the current ACI release 1.1(1o), that you can grab directly from cisco here.
Upload the Firmware to the APIC You can now upload directly through your browser, no longer the need for a SCP/FTP Server!</description>

      <description>Overview I did the Upgrade from Prime Infrastructure 2.1 to Prime Infrastructure 2.2 last week for one of our customers. Unfortunately this upgrade isn&amp;rsquo;t possible &amp;lsquo;in place&amp;rsquo;, you have to install a new Prime Infrastructure 2.2 Server and then import your old configuration.
As described in the Prime Infrastructure 2.2 Quickstart Guide¬†you have to be on one of the following versions that the backup can be used in 2.2:</description>

      <description>I had a hard time to find the correct OID and ended with doing a snmpwalk and try to find the right OID with a grep‚Ä¶
But i think i made it üôÇ
Crosschecked on 2 5760 Clusters and i got the correct count on both, also tried to reboot some APs and the count seems correct to me.
Note: I use 3.6.1 so maybe you get a different result with another software version.</description>

      <description>I did a upgrade of our ACI Lab Fabric last week and documented all the steps. The upgrade is really straightforward, but hopefully this guide still helps you üôÇ
First you have to catch the desired Software, get them directly from cisco. You need APIC Release image for 1.0(3f) release (aci-apic-dk9.1.0.3f.iso) and the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software Release 11.0(3f) (aci-n9000-dk9.11.0.3f.bin). Get them here:

      <description>With the introduction of the NX-OS Cli, cisco changed the way how you connect to leaf/spine switches.
Find my updated post here.
There are several scenarios where you want to connect to your leaf and spine switches of the ACI fabric.
In this example we want to checkout the BGP Status.
First you connect to your APIC Controller through SSH:

      <description>As we all know, the Question mark in IOS is used as interactive help, but what about a ? in a password?
This could for example be a task in your CCIE Lab or at least in on of the many preparation labs.
To use the ? literal just enter crtl+v and then ?
1 2  Rack1SW3(config)#username cisco password SECR? LINE &amp;lt;cr&amp;gt;   ctrl+v ?
