      <description>For whatever reason I decided to give VIM a chance&amp;hellip; crazy guy I am :)
On a bit more serious note, I&amp;rsquo;m sure that VIM is really powerful if you ever get hang of it.
In the past I worked for a long time with Sublime Text 3, which is really great! And in the last ~ year I switched to Visual Studio Code, which is great as well! Especially the multicursor mode is a nifty feature.</description>

      <description>If you are like me and a bit lazy, the touch id is a really nice addition from Apple. It allows for easy lock/unlock of the mac itself and for some authentication within.
By default the touch id is not used for sudo commands in the terminal. For which you will be asked for a password as usual. But it is possible to use the touch id for sudo commands as well, for this you need an extension of the /etc/pam.</description>
