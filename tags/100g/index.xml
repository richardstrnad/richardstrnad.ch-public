      <description>As i described in another Post there is the possibility to change a ACI Leaf Uplink Port to Downlink mode. This can be useful if you require some 40/100G Ports but don&amp;rsquo;t want to add new Leafs.
If you now wan&amp;rsquo;t to convert some of these Downlinks back to Uplinks, you can follow this guide here.
Navigate to Fabric -&amp;gt; Pod and select the Leaf on which you wan&amp;rsquo;t to change the Port behaviour.</description>

      <description>Since ACI release 3.1(1) it&amp;rsquo;s possible to use some of the Leaf Uplinks as Downlink Ports. This could help you out if there is a need for some 40/100G ports but you are currently only running 10/25G Leafs.
Currently the following Leafs support the conversion:
N9K-C9348GC-FXP  N9K-C93180LC-EX   N9K-C93180YC-FX  N9K-C93180YC-EX and N9K-C93180YC-EXU  N9K-C93108TC-EX  N9K-C93108TC-FX  N9K-C9336C-FX2 (only downlink to uplink conversion supported)   There are some limitations, check them out on the Cisco Page.</description>
