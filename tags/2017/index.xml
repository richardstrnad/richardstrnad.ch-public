      <description>I just got the mail that i was accepted to the Cisco Champions 2017 program, this is the first year for me!
What makes a Cisco Champion? Quote from Cisco.com:
 Passion, plus a desire to share their perspectives with the community. There are Cisco Champions all over the world. They represent a variety of segments across the IT industry. And they offer their time to help others learn about Cisco and connect with Cisco in unique ways.</description>
