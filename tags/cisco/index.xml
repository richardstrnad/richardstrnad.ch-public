      <title>ACI: Spine replacement in a single Spine fabric</title>

      <description>A colleague has exchanged a spine at a customer. This is a lab fabric which runs in a minimal setup, 1 x APIC, 1 x Spine, 4 x Leaf.
In principle, the exchange of a Spine within an ACI fabric is a very simple undertaking, ACI does all the heavy lifting for you :)
However, in a scenario where a Leaf has only one path to the APIC (thus connected to a single Spine), the exchange of the Spine leads to problems.</description>

      <description>All new stuff is directly added to my netwrk.ch blog: https://netwrk.ch/posts/restconf/
I decided to migrate this blog here, which was based on wordpress for the past 8 years, to hugo. For this reason, all technical information stays here üòÅ
This post is a work in progress, as i&amp;rsquo;m currently using Restconf for different customer, I want to save/post some of the infos i discovered. Get a Portchannel Subinterface

      <description>Cisco provides a custom ESXi Image/ISO to (re)install Hyperflex Servers. As i&amp;rsquo;m currently working on fully automating the deployment of a large quantity of there servers, i looked for a way to automate the reinstall of these Hyperflex Servers.
Unfortunately the ESXi Image provided by Cisco requires a confirmation at some point, i wanted to get rid of this. First i downloaded the current ISO file from Cisco (HX-ESXi-6.7U3-16316930-Cisco-Custom-6.7.3.5-install-only.iso).
Create the Image 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  cd /tmp mkdir iso cd iso mkdir ro_iso mkdir custom device=$(hdiutil attach -nomount ~/Downloads/HX-ESXi-6.</description>

      <description>As i described in another Post there is the possibility to change a ACI Leaf Uplink Port to Downlink mode. This can be useful if you require some 40/100G Ports but don&amp;rsquo;t want to add new Leafs.
If you now wan&amp;rsquo;t to convert some of these Downlinks back to Uplinks, you can follow this guide here.
Navigate to Fabric -&amp;gt; Pod and select the Leaf on which you wan&amp;rsquo;t to change the Port behaviour.</description>

      <description>With the introduction of the NX-OS like CLI Cisco also added the option to run commands on the switches directly from your apic. It&amp;rsquo;s now even easier to get some infos from one or multiple switches in your fabric.

Correct is Scope=ALL: Role=ROLE_ADMIN
Before that i always got a &amp;lsquo;Invalid Login Credentials&amp;rsquo;, not the best error message üôÇ</description>

You can decrypt password directly through the CLI:

Cisco made this process now way easier, with some cool new features.
In this short guide i used the current ACI release 1.1(1o), that you can grab directly from cisco here.

      <description>Overview I did the Upgrade from Prime Infrastructure 2.1 to Prime Infrastructure 2.2 last week for one of our customers. Unfortunately this upgrade isn&amp;rsquo;t possible &amp;lsquo;in place&amp;rsquo;, you have to install a new Prime Infrastructure 2.2 Server and then import your old configuration.
As described in the Prime Infrastructure 2.2 Quickstart Guide¬†you have to be on one of the following versions that the backup can be used in 2.2:</description>

      <description>I did a upgrade of our ACI Lab Fabric last week and documented all the steps. The upgrade is really straightforward, but hopefully this guide still helps you üôÇ
First you have to catch the desired Software, get them directly from cisco. You need APIC Release image for 1.0(3f) release (aci-apic-dk9.1.0.3f.iso) and the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software Release 11.0(3f) (aci-n9000-dk9.11.0.3f.bin). Get them here:
Cisco ACI Version 1.</description>

      <description>With the introduction of the NX-OS Cli, cisco changed the way how you connect to leaf/spine switches.
Find my updated post here.
There are several scenarios where you want to connect to your leaf and spine switches of the ACI fabric.
In this example we want to checkout the BGP Status.
First you connect to your APIC Controller through SSH:
1 2 3 4  $ ssh admin@10.32.5.100 Application Policy Infrastructure Controller admin@10.</description>

      <description>As we all know, the Question mark in IOS is used as interactive help, but what about a ? in a password?
This could for example be a task in your CCIE Lab or at least in on of the many preparation labs.
To use the ? literal just enter crtl+v and then ?
1 2  Rack1SW3(config)#username cisco password SECR? LINE &amp;lt;cr&amp;gt;   ctrl+v ?
1 2  Rack1SW3(config)#username cisco password SECR?</description>
