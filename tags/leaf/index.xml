      <description>I had a issue today with running remote commands on one of my fabric switches, always generated an error.

      <description>With the introduction of the NX-OS like CLI Cisco also added the option to run commands on the switches directly from your apic. It&amp;rsquo;s now even easier to get some infos from one or multiple switches in your fabric.
Show switchname on a single fabric switch
1 2 3 4 5  apic1# fabric leaf01 show switchname ---------------------------------------------------------------- Node 101 (leaf01) ---------------------------------------------------------------- leaf01   You can also run commands on multiple devices</description>

      <description>Some time ago i posted how you can connect to a spine or leaf switch -&amp;gt; Connect to a leaf/spine switch
With the introduction of NX-OS, the syntax changed a bit. You have now first to drop back to the bash shell and then you can attach the switches. Password is still the same as for the APIC.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  apic1# bash admin@apic1:~&amp;gt; attach leaf01 This command is being deprecated on APIC controller, please use NXOS-style equivalent command # Executing command: ssh leaf01 -b 10.</description>

      <description>Login via SSH or Console to the switch
Make sure that there is an image on the leaf/spine
1 2  leaf01# dir /bootflash/aci-n9000* /bootflash/aci-n9000-dk9.11.0.2j.bin   Make sure that this image is used as bootvar
1 2 3 4  leaf01# cat /mnt/cfg/0/boot/grub/menu.lst.local boot aci-n9000-dk9.11.0.2j.bin leaf01# cat /mnt/cfg/1/boot/grub/menu.lst.local boot aci-n9000-dk9.11.0.2j.bin   If this Image is not set as bootvar, there is a script for that ðŸ™‚
1  leaf01# setup-bootvars.</description>

      <title>Cisco ACI â€“  Upgrade your ACI Fabric (1.0(2j) to 1.0(3f))</title>

      <description>I did a upgrade of our ACI Lab Fabric last week and documented all the steps. The upgrade is really straightforward, but hopefully this guide still helps you ðŸ™‚
First you have to catch the desired Software, get them directly from cisco. You need APIC Release image for 1.0(3f) release (aci-apic-dk9.1.0.3f.iso) and the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software Release 11.0(3f) (aci-n9000-dk9.11.0.3f.bin). Get them here:
Cisco ACI Version 1.</description>

      <description>With the introduction of the NX-OS Cli, cisco changed the way how you connect to leaf/spine switches.
Find my updated post here.
There are several scenarios where you want to connect to your leaf and spine switches of the ACI fabric.
In this example we want to checkout the BGP Status.
First you connect to your APIC Controller through SSH:
1 2 3 4  $ ssh admin@10.32.5.100 Application Policy Infrastructure Controller admin@10.</description>
