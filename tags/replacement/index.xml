      <description>A colleague has exchanged a spine at a customer. This is a lab fabric which runs in a minimal setup, 1 x APIC, 1 x Spine, 4 x Leaf.
In principle, the exchange of a Spine within an ACI fabric is a very simple undertaking, ACI does all the heavy lifting for you :)
However, in a scenario where a Leaf has only one path to the APIC (thus connected to a single Spine), the exchange of the Spine leads to problems.</description>
