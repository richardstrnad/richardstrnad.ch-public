      <description>If you are like me and a bit lazy, the touch id is a really nice addition from Apple. It allows for easy lock/unlock of the mac itself and for some authentication within.
By default the touch id is not used for sudo commands in the terminal. For which you will be asked for a password as usual. But it is possible to use the touch id for sudo commands as well, for this you need an extension of the /etc/pam.</description>
