Cisco made this process now way easier, with some cool new features.
In this short guide i used the current ACI release 1.1(1o), that you can grab directly from cisco here.
Upload the Firmware to the APIC You can now upload directly through your browser, no longer the need for a SCP/FTP Server!</description>

As described in the Prime Infrastructure 2.2 Quickstart GuideÂ you have to be on one of the following versions that the backup can be used in 2.2:</description>

      <description>I did a upgrade of our ACI Lab Fabric last week and documented all the steps. The upgrade is really straightforward, but hopefully this guide still helps you ðŸ™‚
First you have to catch the desired Software, get them directly from cisco. You need APIC Release image for 1.0(3f) release (aci-apic-dk9.1.0.3f.iso) and the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software Release 11.0(3f) (aci-n9000-dk9.11.0.3f.bin). Get them here:
Cisco ACI Version 1.</description>
