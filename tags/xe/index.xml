      <description>I had a hard time to find the correct OID and ended with doing a snmpwalk and try to find the right OID with a grepâ€¦
But i think i made it ðŸ™‚
Crosschecked on 2 5760 Clusters and i got the correct count on both, also tried to reboot some APs and the count seems correct to me.
Note: I use 3.6.1 so maybe you get a different result with another software version.</description>
